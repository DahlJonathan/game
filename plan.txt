Multiplayer and Single-Player Game Instructions

Languages and Technologies

Frontend (Client-side)
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla, no frameworks)
DOM Manipulation: Directly using JavaScript (document.createElement, appendChild, etc.)
Animations: requestAnimationFrame() for smooth 60 FPS updates
Input Handling: Keyboard events (keydown, keyup) for player movement
Audio: Audio API for sound effects
Networking: WebSockets (Socket.IO or native WebSocket API) to sync game state
State Management: JavaScript objects to store player positions, scores, and game state

Backend (Server-side)

Languages: Node.js (for WebSocket server)
Frameworks: Express.js (for handling HTTP requests and serving static files)
Real-time Communication: Socket.IO or native WebSockets
Game State Management: Store active players, positions, scores, and game timer
Hosting: Expose the game online using Ngrok, a cloud server, or a dedicated domain
Persistence (Optional): PostgreSQL or MongoDB for saving match results
Utilities: UUID for generating unique player IDs

Key Features and Functionalities

Multiplayer Mode
1 Real-time Synchronization: Players join via a unique URL/IP.
2 Player Controls: Implement smooth and responsive keyboard-based movement.
3 Game State Management: The server ensures all clients see the same game state.
4 Scoring System: Tracks scores and lives, updates in real-time.
5 Game Timer: Synchronized countdown or count-up timer.
6 Game Menu: Includes pause, resume, restart, and quit options.
7 Sound Effects: Preloaded sounds for game events.
8 Smooth Animation: Uses requestAnimationFrame() to maintain 60 FPS.

Single-Player Mode
1 Game Mode Toggle: Menu option to switch between single-player and multiplayer.

2 AI Opponents (NPCs):
Replace missing players with AI (1-3 opponents).
Implement difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.
NPCs mimic human behavior with randomized strategies.

3 Game Logic Unchanged:
AI follows the same rules as real players.
Modify game loop to update NPCs only in single-player mode.

4 Ensuring Multiplayer Stability:
Single-player mode doesn’t interfere with multiplayer sessions.
AI opponents act as real players within the same ruleset.




Game Logic Implementation

Multiplayer Synchronization
Clients send movement/input updates to the server.
The server tracks player positions, scores, and the game state.
Server broadcasts updates to all players.

Smooth Animation
Use requestAnimationFrame() to update player positions.
Minimize DOM reflows by batching updates.
Avoid forced layout recalculations.

Game Menu & State Management
Pause Menu: Stops animations, displays overlay.
Restart: Resets scores, positions, and timer.
Quit: Notifies other players and removes player from the game.

Keyboard Controls
keydown, keyup event listeners ensure responsive movement.
Prevent input lag by queuing key presses.

Sound Effects
Preloaded audio to avoid lag.
Sounds play on collision, win/loss, and interactions.
